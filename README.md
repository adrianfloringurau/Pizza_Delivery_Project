Hello and welcome to my repository!

This is a C# project that I made during university, but I did want to make it more complex than it should have been.
It is not finished, as it does not have the Client and Delivery features, but the Admin panel is quite complete.
As you can figure out, the clients should be able to place some pizza orders and delivery men should be able to lock them.
The complicated thing of this project was setting up a stable many-to-many relationship between Pizza and Ingredient tables/classes.
